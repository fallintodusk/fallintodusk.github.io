# Alis Open Development Policy (AODL) v2.0

This repository is multi-licensed by component. AODL is the project's licensing **policy**, not a single combined license. Each component uses a real, established license — no modifications, no contradictions.

For the project's values and social contract, see [ALIS_PACT.md](ALIS_PACT.md).
