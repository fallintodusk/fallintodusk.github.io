# The Alis Pact

This is not a license. This is a social contract between the people who build Alis and the people who play, host, and extend it.

Licenses protect code. This pact protects intent.

## What Alis Is

Alis is an open game that teaches real skills through gameplay, simulates real-world survival, and connects people around shared values. The code is open. The world is protected. The community is the foundation.

## Commitments

### To players

- No pay-to-win. Monetization serves the game, not the other way around.
- No predatory mechanics. No loot boxes, no artificial scarcity designed to exploit.
- Your data is yours. Privacy by default.
- Community servers are welcome. If you want to host Alis for your friends, do it. We encourage it.

### To contributors

- Your work is respected. Contributions are credited, never silently absorbed.
- You keep your copyright. We use DCO, not CLA. We don't take your rights.
- No surprise relicensing. License changes are versioned, announced 30 days in advance, and never retroactive.
- If you build something great on top of Alis, we celebrate it.

### To the ecosystem

- Code is open (AGPL-3.0-only). Anyone can read, learn, fork, and improve.
- Improvements flow back. The copyleft ensures that hosted forks share their changes with everyone.
- The world (art, lore, music) is non-commercial (CC BY-NC-SA). You can create, remix, and share — but not extract and sell what the community built.

### To ourselves

- We sustain the project through official services, assets, and brand — not by locking down code.
- We build in the open because we believe transparency makes better software.
- We adapt. If something in this pact stops serving the project and its people, we change it — openly, with notice.

## What we ask in return

- Share your improvements. Don't fork and hide.
- Respect the brand. Call your fork something else.
- Don't extract without giving back. If you profit from Alis code, share your changes (AGPL requires this).
- Be honest. That's the whole point.

## Governance

Alis is maintained by its founders. As the community grows, governance will evolve. The direction is toward more voices, not fewer. This section will be updated as that happens.

## Living document

This pact evolves with the project. Changes are tracked in version control and announced publicly. The spirit remains: build together, share honestly, protect the work.
