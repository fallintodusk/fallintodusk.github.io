The Mesh, Material, and Texture folders are base resources. We separate them from Objects and Elements, which contain more complex game entities built on top of these bases.
Mesh (Cube, Plane, Pipe) contains only primitive geometries from which different objects can be created - for example, a Cube can become a wooden crate or a dumpster - while unique models are kept in Objects.
The Material folder stores universal shaders, Material Layers, and base materials that serve as the foundation for complex materials in Elements (world-space projection, no UVs) and atlas materials in Objects (specific to a particular item). It also includes material functions used for modular development.
Texture contains environment cubemaps and sets of repeating patterns (templates, motifs) - for example, tile, brick, fabric, wood - applicable to many materials and meshes, such as for tables, floors, or walls.
Assets in these folders are like building blocks for complex structures: they’re modular and each has its own purpose.
