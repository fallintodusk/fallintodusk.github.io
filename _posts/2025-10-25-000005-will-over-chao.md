We are a small, tight-knit team, bound by a systemic approach and the will to build a game that brings real benefit - useful knowledge and skills.
Each of us carries a distinct path. Our knowledge and training span conflict studies, physics, computer science, architecture, economic geography, and data structuring.
We work to make a game that can be felt - and that carries meaning.
