Objects is a repository of grouped game entities with unique identity, placed in the game world.
As in Elements, the structure keeps a clear split into Human Made and Nature, each with its own internal hierarchy and subcategories.
An object folder contains static or skeletal meshes and, when necessary, unique materials and textures, blueprints, and other relevant assets required to fully describe the object.
The main issue with many unique objects is significant project size growth, degraded performance, and increased complexity in controlling and maintaining code and assets.
We aim to build a universal and scalable structure based on combining reusable abstractions of materials and meshes.
