We accept the challenge - to create a world harsh and real down to the last detail, without killing the soul of the game.  
We expose the abyss of warâ€™s tragedy and, with clear-eyed honesty, the depth of human grief, loneliness, distance.  
Our mission is to make Alis a tool for growth that helps you better understand yourself, those around you, and life itself.  
May the project bring meaningful experiences and real connection.
