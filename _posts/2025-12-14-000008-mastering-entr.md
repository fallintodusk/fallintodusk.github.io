Elements is the place for seamless, universal materials that are reused many times and applied to any static objects. They do not need the object’s UV unwrap - they use world-space coordinates.
Inside, we logically and efficiently divide these materials by origin:
Human Made - artificial (made by humans), grouped by type and then by subtype: Bitumen, Cement, Metal, Glass, Clay, Fabric, Paint, Synthetic, Wood, etc.
Nature - natural, by environment type and vegetation variety: Rock, Sand, Soil, Grass, Bark.
This classification reflects the real world, simplifies asset organization, and makes scaling and discoverability easier.
We use a multi-layer material structure that lets us combine different properties. Layers can drive both the object’s surface character and effects - dirt, dust, scratches, wetness, and more. We aim to create materials using a seamless technique that automatically tiles in world space from any viewpoint.
