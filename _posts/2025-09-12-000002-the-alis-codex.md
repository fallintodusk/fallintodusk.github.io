Alis cuts the noise: the game turns experience into skill and brings it back to real life.
Connections. Our goal is to create connections between people and support their interaction in the real world.
Resources. You learn to use resources effectively: water, food (real caloric value), sleep, injuries; energy drains by activity.
Mechanics. Realistic mechanics with practical value - sense beyond the screen.
Knowledge. A variety of useful information reinforced through gameplay as skills.
Learn. Survive. Connect - we’re in your next decision.
