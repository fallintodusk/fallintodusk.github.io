One of our ongoing primary goals has been to create and maintain a library of general-purpose game assets for convenient reuse. An organized project structure makes complex development faster - and, in fact, possible at all.
The main folder for assets is Resources, which consists of: Material, Textures, Mesh, Elements, and Objects - so you can quickly focus on a specific entity. Each folder has its own level of abstraction, strengthening control over adding, modifying, and using assets. For example, Objects contains unique items (a specific car, a door, a self-contained prop), while the other categories can be applied more broadly to different things.
This classification simplifies navigation, helps you stay oriented in the project, and accelerates development by making it clear where each entity resides. Thanks to this approach, fewer mistakes occur - duplicates are avoided, and the right assets are used and quickly found.
